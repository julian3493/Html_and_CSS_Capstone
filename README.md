# Html_and_CSS_Capstone

> I am a Microverse student doing the HTML and CSS capstone project. I followed the design of the directory of schools [Patashule](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) to make a website with different content but keeping the layout and colors from the original design.
